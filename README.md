# Athlete Assessment & Evaluation System Prototype (MERN Stack)

This project is a MERN-stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) prototype for an Athlete Assessment and Evaluation System. It aims to provide functionalities for managing assessments, sessions, batches, capturing athlete data, benchmarking, scoring, reporting, and user management.

This README provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and current development status.

## Current Development Status

The project has progressed through several phases, focusing on building a foundational structure and then implementing core logic.

**Phase 1: Scaffolding (Complete)**
Initial scaffolding for all core features (Sections 1-10) is complete. This includes:
*   **Backend**: Models, controllers, routes for all primary entities (Assessments, Sessions, Batches, Entries, Benchmarks, Users, Comments, Notifications, Audit Logs). Basic middleware for auth (placeholders), audit logging, security (helmet, cors), and rate limiting. Swagger API documentation setup.
*   **Frontend**: Basic React application structure, API services for all backend modules, and placeholder pages/components for core features. Routing is set up in `App.js`.

**Phase 2: Core Logic Implementation (Complete - Initial Pass)**
Focused on wiring up the scaffolded parts to create a functional data flow:
*   **Data Entry Refinement**: Improved client-side validation on forms and server-side type checking for assessment entries. Implemented CSV bulk upload functionality (client-side parsing, backend processing).
*   **Benchmark Calculation**: Implemented statistical logic (mean, standard deviation, percentiles using R-7 method) in `benchmarkController.js`.
*   **Normalization & Scoring**: Implemented logic in `batchController.js` to calculate Z-scores, estimated percentile ranks (based on benchmark P-values), and performance bands for assessment entries, saving these back to the database.
*   **Dashboard Display (Initial)**: Ensured `IndividualReportPage.js` can display calculated scores. `CohortAnalyticsPage.js` updated to display aggregated numbers and an initial bar chart for average Z-scores using `Chart.js`.

**Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements & Communication Features (Complete - Initial Pass)**
Focused on improving user experience and adding communication features:
*   **Toast Notifications**: Implemented `react-toastify` for user feedback across login, registration, data entry, and list page actions.
*   **Backend Notification Triggers**: Added placeholder calls to a `sendNotification` function in backend controllers for events like batch publishing, new comments, and results processing.
*   **Comment UI Enhancements**: `IndividualReportPage.js` comment section updated with a threaded display structure and basic UI/handlers for adding, editing, deleting, and replying to comments.
*   **In-App Notification System (Basic)**:
    *   Backend: `UserNotificationModel`, enhanced `notificationController` to create DB notifications, and `userNotificationRoutes`.
    *   Frontend: `notificationService.js` and a `NotificationBell` component in the Navbar to display notifications.

**Phase 4: QA, Performance, Security, Documentation (In Progress - Current Phase)**
Focusing on refining and hardening the application:
*   **Security Enhancements**:
    *   Added `express-rate-limit` to backend API routes, with stricter limits on auth endpoints.
    *   Applied placeholder `protect` and `authorize` middleware calls to all relevant backend routes to clearly define intended access control (actual JWT logic and role enforcement to be fully implemented).
*   **Documentation**: This README is being updated. Swagger API documentation is set up.
*   **Deployment**: Basic `vercel.json` created.
*   **Conceptual Reviews**: Ongoing mental checks for QA, performance, and security considerations.

**Next Steps (High-Level within Phase 4 and beyond):**

*   **Full Auth Implementation**: Replace placeholder JWT logic and auth middleware with robust JWT-based authentication and authorization. Thoroughly test role-based access control.
*   **Complete Notification System**: Implement actual email/SMS sending. Refine in-app notification delivery and UI.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
*   **Detailed UI/UX Polish**: Implement a consistent design system/UI library. Improve responsiveness and accessibility.
*   **Advanced Reporting & Dashboards**: Add more chart types, interactivity, filtering, and customization to reports.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Database query optimization, frontend bundle optimization, caching strategies.
*   **Full Security Audit & Hardening**: Penetration testing, dependency vulnerability scanning, review all security best practices.
*   **Complete API Documentation**: Ensure all endpoints are fully documented in Swagger.
*   **User Documentation**: Create guides for different user roles.

## Project Structure
(The project structure diagram previously here remains largely the same, but now more fleshed out)
```
.
├── backend/
├── frontend/
├── package.json        # Root package.json (if used for concurrently, currently not)
├── vercel.json         # Vercel deployment configuration
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Getting Started
(Instructions remain similar to previous version, emphasizing local MongoDB and Node.js setup)

**Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js and npm (or Yarn)
*   MongoDB (local instance or connection URI)

**Backend Setup:**
1.  `cd backend`
2.  `npm install`
3.  Create `config/config.env` (see `backend/config/config.env` example in prior versions for MONGO_URI, PORT, JWT_SECRET).
4.  `npm run dev`

**Frontend Setup:**
1.  `cd frontend`
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm start` (usually runs on `http://localhost:3000` and proxies API calls to backend on PORT 5001 or as configured).

## Key Technologies
(List remains similar, with additions like `bcryptjs`, `swagger-jsdoc`, `react-toastify`, `chart.js`, `papaparse`, `helmet`, `cors`, `express-rate-limit` now actively used or configured).

*   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, bcryptjs, JWT (planned), Helmet, CORS, Express-Rate-Limit, Swagger.
*   **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Axios, Chart.js, React-Chartjs-2, Papaparse, React-Toastify.

## Phase 4 Considerations & Next Steps in a Real Project

*   **Completed in this simulated Phase 4:**
    *   Basic rate limiting applied to backend APIs.
    *   Placeholder authentication/authorization middleware applied across all routes.
    *   `vercel.json` created for deployment.
    *   This README updated.
*   **Immediate Next Steps in a Real Project:**
    1.  **Full Authentication & Authorization**: Implement robust JWT generation, verification, and hook up the `protect` and `authorize` middleware to enforce actual roles and permissions based on a live user session.
    2.  **Thorough Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for backend logic (especially calculations, auth, data validation) and frontend components/services. Start E2E testing key user flows.
    3.  **Error Handling**: Implement a centralized error handling middleware on the backend. Improve frontend error boundaries and user feedback for API errors.
    4.  **User Management UI**: If admins need to manage users (CRUD, roles, scopes), build out these UI sections.
    5.  **Data Seeding**: Create scripts to seed initial data (e.g., admin user, notification templates, sample assessment templates) for easier development and testing.
